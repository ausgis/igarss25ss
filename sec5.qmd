# Student Challenge Example Datasets {.unnumbered}

To facilitate student participation, we provide several remote sensing-related datasets that can be used directly, or participants may use their own data and study areas.

### Example Datasets

- **Sentinel-2 Land Cover Sample (China)**  
  A subset of Sentinel-2 imagery with land cover labels across several cities.

- **MODIS NDVI Time-Series Data**  
  Monthly NDVI values from MODIS over East Asia, useful for modeling vegetation trends.

- **Surface Temperature and Elevation Data (ASTER GDEM + MODIS LST)**  
  Combined raster datasets useful for spatial regression or GPBoost modeling.

Participants are encouraged to explore these examples or bring their own datasets. GPBoost is especially effective in settings where **structured covariates** (e.g., reflectance bands, indices) and **spatial dependence** exist.
