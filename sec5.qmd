# Practice and Example Datasets {.unnumbered}

To facilitate student participation, we provide several example geospatial datasets that can be used directly (including temperature, precipitation, and wildfire burn area data for the corresponding regions in 2024), or participants may use their own data and study areas.

### Example Datasets

* **Butte County, California (USA)**
  Site of the 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest wildfire in California history. Suitable for studying extreme wildfire impacts and recovery. [data file](https://github.com/ausgis/igarss25ss/tree/main/data/student_challenge_datasets/butte)

* **Shasta County, California (USA)**
  Known for recurring large wildfires, including the 2018 Carr Fire. Features varied topography and dense vegetation. [data file](https://github.com/ausgis/igarss25ss/tree/main/data/student_challenge_datasets/shasta)

* **Boulder County, Colorado (USA)**
  Located at the plains-mountain interface. High wildfire risk due to dry grasslands, suburban expansion, and strong wind events. [data file](https://github.com/ausgis/igarss25ss/tree/main/data/student_challenge_datasets/boulder)

Participants are encouraged to explore these examples or bring their own datasets. GPBoost is especially effective in settings where **structured covariates** (e.g., reflectance bands, indices) and **spatial dependence** exist.
